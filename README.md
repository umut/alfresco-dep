## Introduction
This project contains pom artifacts for different versions of Alfresco in order to manage dependencies via maven.

## Usage
In order to use it you have to use it in combination with the custom repository defined in the pom file. For more information please see my related [blog post](http://www.codinginahurry.com/2010/12/10/making-alfresco-maven-friendly/). I am too lazy to repeat the same thing in two places :)
